Here is a mini project that I did as a requirement for data analyst candidate in Company "X"

1. First of all, I was given raw data (Case studies data analyst 1.csv) about drug sales and I was asked to do analysis and visualization.
Full details regarding the instructions can be checked in the "Study Analyst Study Case" file in the main directory.

2. I'm doing processing in Google BigQuery with the aim of generating a new column, namely "profit" (bigquery.sql) with the conditions stated in "Data Analyst Study Case".

3. After that, the data that I processed is ready to be visualized (Data_Analyst_Study_Case.pdf) based on the criteria specified in the "Data Analyst Study Case" description.
